### Reactive vs Template Driven Forms

## Template Driven

# Pros: 
Built mostly in HTML, so you can modify it in the HTML
Is immune to being modified easily; remains static

# Cons:
Can't modify it very easily; need to add a lot of HTML code to set up controls
Can't access it programmatically

## Reactive

# Pros:
Placed mostly in the component's typscript file, so it can be accessed and modified easily.
Can access it programmatically, like you would any other object
Easier to get values

# Cons:
Hard to set up
Usually not worth it on smaller projects

## Final Thoughts

Forms are a pain to work with, but Reactive Forms feel like the better option, due to their customisability.
